You can probably learn most about me by reading my [/word](https://christinchong.com/word) and [/now](https://christinchong.com/now) pages.

This website was created using [Reverie](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie), a Jekyll theme created by [Amit Merchant](https://www.amitmerchant.com) based on a fork of [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). Thanks Amit!

# Change log
2020-05-16: Updated fonts and layout to improve website esthetics. In particular, used Kevin McGillivray's [typeguide.css](https://github.com/kmcgillivray/typeguide.css), which is in turn inspired by [Butterick's Practical Typography](https://practicaltypography.com).
