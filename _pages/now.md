## Cultivation:
* Continuing with IMC's [Eightfold Path](https://www.insightmeditationcenter.org/2019/08/the-eightfold-path-program-2019-2020/) program, by Zoom.
* Hosting [IMC](https://insightmeditationcenter.org) neighborhood Zoom meditation group, 2-weekly.
* Continuing to support [Alliance for Bhikkhunis](https://bhikkhuni.net) as co-treasurer.

## Connection: 
* COVID-19 New World continues. Washing hands furiously with Jewel's [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr8UJ6I3My4) stuck in my head.

## Creativity: 
* Trying to write imperfect blog entries here and share more of what's top of mind. If not now, when? It's the apocalypse, afterall.

## Constitution:

## Currency:
* Excited about a new career opportunity and learning all I can!
* Still using [Lunch Money](https://my.lunchmoney.app/refer/fd1qf9b6), a delightful budgeting app.
