# What I'm Doing Now - Last updated: 2020-04-10

## Cultivation:
* Continuing with IMC's [Eightfold Path](https://www.insightmeditationcenter.org/2019/08/the-eightfold-path-program-2019-2020/) program, by Zoom.
* Hosting [IMC](https://insightmeditationcenter.org) neighborhood Zoom meditation group, monthly.
* Continuing to support [Alliance for Bhikkhunis](https://bhikkhuni.net) especially for COVID-19.

## Connection: 
* Welp, COVID-19 life adaptation. Lots of Zoom with friends and staying inside. Washing hands furiously.

## Creativity: 
* Trying to write imperfect blog entries here and share more of what's top of mind. If not now, when? It's the apocalypse, afterall.
* Working on a project aimed at honest conversations around connections with family and loved ones, from the Asian perspective.

## Constitution:
* Working on left shoulder recovery through daily foam rolling and trigger point self-massage.
* Daily cardio with vertical climber, walking up and down the stairs.

## Currency:
* Discovered [Lunch Money](https://my.lunchmoney.app/refer/fd1qf9b6), a delightful budgeting app. Still need to populate based on backlogged data.
