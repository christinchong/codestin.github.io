## Connection:

## Creativity: 
* Trying to write imperfect blog entries here and share more of what's top of mind. If not now, when? It's the apocalypse, afterall.
* Working on a project aimed at honest conversations around connections with family and loved ones, from the Asian perspective.
* Learning to play [The Shape of Things to Come](https://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtd.asp?ppn=MN0093764) as heard on Battlestar Galactica on the piano

## Constitution:
* Working on left shoulder recovery through daily foam rolling and trigger point self-massage.

## Currency:
* Discovered [Lunch Money](https://my.lunchmoney.app/refer/fd1qf9b6), a delightful budgeting app. Still need to populate based on backlogged data.
