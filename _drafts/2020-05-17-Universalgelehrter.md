My friend Miri taught me what the German equivalent of "Jack of all trades" is--apparently there are two possible terms:

- Hansdampf in allen gassen = jacksteam in all alleys (it isn't a flattering term, more along the lines of jack of all trades, master of none)
- Universalgelehrter = polymath, renaissance person

I went to the Wikipedia entry for Universalgelehrter, and found that the Chinese equivalents are 文藝復興人, 博学家, 通才. I was surprised that there wasn't a link to the ideals of an ancient Chinese scholar, which is mastery over the [Four Arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_arts). Back then, a scholar-official was expected to be fluent in:

- Qin 琴 - Playing the seven-stringed zither instrument, essentially an old-timey Chinese guitar
- Qi 棋 - Playing Go
- Shu 書 - Mastering the art of calligraphy 
- Hua 畫 - Mastering the art of painting

What I find interesting is that we seem to have preserved and evolved our collective desire to master these skills in modern day forms:

- Music playing is now accessible in many forms (one does not even need an instrument if you have a computer/smart phone handy)
- Strategy-based board games are all the rage (I am partial Legends of Runeterra at the moment)
- Calligraphy continues to be admired even though we type more than we write
- Visual art can be made with digital medium, though real life paintings are much admired

The question is--how can one be good at all four? Historically, were most of these learned people truly good at all four, or did they specialize in certain skills? Is it bad to be a Hansdampf in allen Gassen? To me, I most admire people who are able to combine 2-3 common skill sets and provide a service/skill/product that fit a niche need. 

I also wonder, how did ancient Chinese scholars arrive at these four categories? It is possible that some of these skills serve the professional needs of the scholar officials (e.g. calligraphy is necessary for legal texts and record keeping, Go for strategic thinking), but music playing and painting seem to be done for the sake of the art form and beauty itself. (Or perhaps our ancestors knew that music and visual art stimulated neural pathways, which might increase creativity?) I find myself wishing to incorporate more of these skills into every day activities. Perhaps I should start adding some visuals to the blog? Or handwrite entries and use OCR to transcribe them?
