I took some time to properly set up a web developer environment with this useful [shell script](https://github.com/monfresh/laptop) to make it easier to update this website. I was using the web editor (!) to make changes, which is quite inefficient, with changing CSS all but impossible except for the most patient of folks.

I'm proudest of the following:
- Finding a font I really like--you are looking at Merriweather Light (font weight of 300), inspired by [The Plain Text Project](https://plaintextproject.online/)
- Implementing Kevin McGillivray's [typeguide.css](https://github.com/kmcgillivray/typeguide.css), which is in turn inspired by [Butterick's Practical Typography](https://practicaltypography.com). This ensures proper font size proportions that is also responsive for mobile viewing
- Changed color scheme to match my [Word](https://christinchong.com/word) of 2020 ðŸ”¥
- Changed the date display format to [ISO 8601](https://xkcd.com/1179)

The categories page still looks a bit strange, but I may redo categories/tagging altogether.
